# README for Apr 10 Workshop

This repository is the main repository containing all deliverables for the Data Science Workshop from IK on **Data Science in Practice: Personalized Content Recommendations**. During this session we walked through how to perform elementary exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, manipulation, processing, cleaning, and created a simple recommendation algorithm. 

This contains the initial session notebook that we ran through, the amazon data, as well as powerpoint docs. The final session notebook with outputs will get posted after the session is complete.
